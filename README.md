# app-identity

This repo holds the service for users to verify their different user accounts on CENNZnet

It consists of two key parts:

- The user facing web app which will allow users to sign in and sign transactions
  from their browser using the CENNZnet wallet extension.
- The Identity Background Service (IBS) which acts as a registrar and performs the validation and pairs up
  user identity requests with their verified details
